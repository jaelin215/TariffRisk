# TariffRisk

## Scalable Machine Learning Service (with Docker, CI/CD, and planned support for Optuna + Airflow)

This project demonstrates **ONE core capability**:
> I can build, optimize, test, and deploy production-ready ML services that are scalable, modular, cloud-native, and collaborative.

Built as a technical showcase for roles like **Senior Data Scientist / ML Engineer**. This repo integrates everything needed to move fast, ship weekly, and handle complexity.

### ‚öôÔ∏è Data & Motivation

This project uses a publicly available dataset sourced from **Kaggle** (https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/mesumraza/trump-tarrif-data).  
The core motivation is to preprocess and transform this data to build a reliable predictive model for **tariff risk scoring**‚Äîhelping merchants who sell their merchandise globally through platforms like **Shopify, Amazon**, and other e-commerce marketplaces assess and manage the risk of tariffs.

Beyond just modeling, this repo serves as a template for developing production-ready, scalable ML pipelines around complex, real-world trade compliance challenges faced by online merchants.
*Note: The realistic prediction of the tariff risk score is not implemented yet and remains a key upcoming milestone for this project. For now, a simple compute was use to demonstrate the capability.*

### ‚ùì Problem This Project Solves
Real-world ML system fail when they lack:
- Reproducibility (unclear training/testing bounaries)
- Optimization (manual hyperparameter tuning or guesswork)
- Scalability (not containerized or cloud deployable)
- Team collaboration (no tests, no CI/CD, messy structure)

This repo fixes that. It's a blueprint for building and collaborating on real-world ML systems.

### üß± Project Structure
- app/ - Logical sepearation of all core logic (i.e. models, routes, services, and config). Promotes modularity and ease of onboarding for other team members
- airflow/ - Embedded inside the app/. Realistic for small-to-mid ML projects that don't need a separate Airflow repo. Keeps retraining logic tightly coupled with the prediction logic, improving traceability.
- tests/ - Clean and organized. Unit tests per service/module file (i.e. test_predict.py, test_optuna.py). Easy plug-in for CI with pytest.
- github/workflows/ci.yml - Clean adn minimal. It shows DevOps maturity: CI/CD with GitHub Actions. Makes the project team- and cloud- ready.
- Dockerfile, .dockerignore, .gitignore - Full containerization, cloud-deployability, and local development efficiency.
- Makefile - Developer friendliness (make test, make buid, make run)
- pyproject.toml - Care about formatting, linting, and build config. Using modern Python tooling (black, isort, pytest, etc.) 


‚ö†Ô∏è Note: airflow/ and optuna/ are scaffolded but not yet functional. They will be integrated in the next release to support full retraining workflows and search optimization pipelines.

üß™ Testing & CI/CD
	‚Ä¢	pytest for local + CI test runs
	‚Ä¢	make test to run tests locally
	‚Ä¢	GitHub Actions triggers CI on manual workflow run (note: it can be easily changed to triggered by push/pull or scheduled cron job)


üê≥ Containerization
	‚Ä¢	Full Docker setup with Dockerfile and .dockerignore
	‚Ä¢	Easily deployable on GCP, AWS, or Azure
	‚Ä¢	Lightweight dev experience via GitHub Codespaces


üõ† Dev UX
	‚Ä¢	Makefile for fast local commands (make run, make test, etc.)
	‚Ä¢	pyproject.toml to manage formatting (black, isort) and linting in one place


üìå Coming Soon
	‚Ä¢	Optuna integration for clean, modular hyperparameter search
	‚Ä¢	Airflow DAG for scheduled retraining + monitoring
	‚Ä¢	Looker dashboard template + auto-publishing
	‚Ä¢	GitHub Codespace one-click launch config
